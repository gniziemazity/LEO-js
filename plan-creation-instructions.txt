[Trying to create a prompt teaching an LLM to make a lesson plan from a given code]

Create a JSON-formatted lesson plan for an auto-typing live coding tool based on provided source code.

1. Special Key Mapping: Use these symbols to represent keyboard actions:

↢: Backspace | 💾: Save (Ctrl+S) | Ö: Switch Tab (Alt+Tab) | ö: Run (Ctrl+F5)

↑, ↓, ←, →: Arrow Keys

⇑, ⇓, ⇐, ⇒: Shift + Arrows

▼/▲: Page Down/Up | ◄: Home | ►: End | ‒: Tab

2. Typing Style:

Tag/Brace Pairing: Always type opening and closing tags or braces together first (e.g., <html></html> or function(){}).

Always prefix </html> with backspace (↢) for compatibility with VS Code's auto formatting.

Navigation: Immediately after pairing, use ↑ and ► to move the cursor inside the block to continue typing content.

Flat Structure: Do NOT use any tabs or leading spaces for indentation. All code must start at the very beginning of the line.

3. Pedagogical Structure:

Iterative Development: Do not dump large blocks of code. Build the project piece-by-piece. The order of writing the code should enable as frequent testing / debugging as possible.

Frequent Testing / Debugging: Include a save (💾), a browser test/switch (Ö) and refresh (ö) at every possible milestone (e.g., after adding a title, after styling a background).

Teacher Notes: Every comment block must include quick notes explaining what to say or what to look for during the "Debug" phase.

If necessary, use the => <old code> syntax in a comment block to indicate to the teacher to move to a specific line before modifying it.

If necessary, use the => <file name> syntax (e.g., => main.js) to indicate switching files (in the comment type block).

Logic Flow: For web projects, start with HTML boilerplate, move to CSS for visibility, then basic JS, then complex logic.

When creating a new file, link it first (in HTML), then add a comment block asking to Ctrl + Click so VS Code automatically creates it and moves into the new file.

4. JSON Format: Output a list of objects: {"type": "comment", "text": "..."} or {"type": "code", "text": "..."}.
